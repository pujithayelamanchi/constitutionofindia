        <div id="in">The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India.[2][3] The document lays down the framework
            that
            demarcates fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions
            and
            sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens, based on the proposal
            suggested
            by M.N. Roy. It is the longest written national constitution in the world.[4][5][6]</div>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <div>With the exception of scattered French and Portuguese exclaves, India was under the British rule from 1858
            to
            1947. From 1947 to 1950, the same legislation continued to be implemented as India was a dominion of United
            Kingdom for these three years, as each princely state was convinced by Sardar Patel and V. P. Menon to sign
            the
            articles of integration with India, and the British Government continued to be responsible for the external
            security of the country.[15] Thus, the constitution of India repealed the Indian Independence Act 1947 and
            Government of India Act 1935 when it became effective on 26 January 1950. India ceased to be a dominion of
            the
            British Crown and became a sovereign, democratic republic with the constitution. Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60,
            324, 366, 367, 379, 380, 388, 391, 392, 393, and 394 of the constitution came into force on 26 November
            1949,
            and the remaining articles became effective on 26 January 1950 which is celebrated every year in India as
            Republic Day.[16]</div>
        <h2>Previous legislation</h2>
        <div>The constitution was drawn from a number of sources. Mindful of India's needs and conditions, its framers
            borrowed features of previous legislation such as the Government of India Act 1858, the Indian Councils Acts
            of
            1861, 1892 and 1909, the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935, and the Indian Independence Act 1947. The
            latter, which led to the creation of Pakistan, divided the former Constituent Assembly in two. The Amendment
            act
            of 1935 is also a very important step for making the constitution for two new born countries. Each new
            assembly
            had sovereign power to draft and enact a new constitution for the separate states.[17]</div>
